Code book for Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project
The data set that this code book pertains to is located in the tidy_data.txt file of this repository.
See the README.md file of this repository for background information on this data set.

Data Source and Transformation
The zip file containing the source data is located at:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The Raw data has been processed using the following steps.
•	The training and test sets were merged to create one data set.
•	The measurements on the mean and standard deviation 
•	The activity identifiers 
•	The variable names were replaced with descriptive variable names
•	The final data set was created with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Variables
Each row contains, for a given subject and activity, 79 averaged signal measurements.
Identifiers
•	subject (Subject identifier)
•	activity
The set of variables that were estimated (and kept for this assignment) from these signals are:
•	mean(): Mean value
•	std(): Standard deviation

The collection of the source data and the transformations listed above were implemented by the run_analysis.R R script (see README.md file for usage instructions).
